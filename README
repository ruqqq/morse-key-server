Morse Key Server
Developed by Faruq Rasid (ruqqq.sg)

This is the official implementation of Morse Key Server. Custom implementation is possible but _have_ to follow the same spec to ensure the app works as expected.

This implementation uses CouchDB as the data layer.

URL POINTS
-----------
Request Key (through generating package):
http://localhost:port/?sender_id=###&recipient_id=###&me=###
						--or--
http://localhost:port/?sender_id=###&group_id=###&me=###

Retrieve Package:
http://localhost:port/?package_id=###

SERVER FLOW
-----------
Client request either of the above end point with the corresponding parameters. Sender_id, recipient_id and me are hashed ids of the user and only group_id is NOT hashed (at least for now).

1. Server contacts Main server to check for ids validity and retrieve the required public keys.
2. Server generates a key (random bytes of a predefined length base64-ed) and encrypt it with the requester public key
3. Server store this encrypted key in database along with sender_id and recipient_id/group_id so that the key remain consistent
4. Server generate a package with the key and relevant hashed ids along with package_id which is encrypted with the public key and send to requester
5. Requester decrypts the package_id_encrypted and retrieves the package
6. Decrypted key_encrypted field in package is the generated key to be used for AES (or other) encryption

INSTALL & RUN
-----------
1. git clone https://github.com/ruqqq/morse-key-server.git
2. npm install
3. copy config.sample.coffee to config.coffee and modify accordingly
